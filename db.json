Here's a short, three-paragraph blog sample you can use for \"Barbie Dreams\" — it has a dreamy, reflective tone but keeps things light and personal:\n\n✨ Barbie Dreams: More Than Just Plastic\n\nGrowing up, Barbie wasn’t just a doll — she was a whole world. From astronaut to vet to popstar, she made it feel like anything was possible. I’d line them up on my pink carpet, each one with a different story, a different dream. And in between brushing their hair and switching outfits, I was building the confidence to imagine my own dreams, too.\n\nAs I got older, I realized Barbie was more than just fun — she was kind of iconic. Sure, she’s been criticized, but she’s also evolved. Now she comes in all shapes, skin tones, and styles, showing that “Barbie” isn’t a one-size-fits-all fantasy. That shift? It matters. Because representation in even the smallest things — like toys — has power.\n\nToday, I look back at those Barbie dreams with a soft smile. They were playful and bold, a little sparkly and a little wild. But most importantly, they were mine. And maybe that’s what Barbie really gave us — permission to imagine, reimagine, and always dream a little bigger.\n\n",
